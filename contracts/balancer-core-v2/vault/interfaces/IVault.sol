interface IVault {
    // Generalities about the Vault:
    //
    // - Whenever documentation refers to 'tokens', it strictly refers to ERC20-compliant token contracts. Tokens are
    // transferred out of the Vault by calling the `IERC20.transfer` function, and transferred in by calling
    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.
    // Contracts calling view functions in the Vault must make sure the Vault has not already been entered.
    //
    // - View functions revert if referring to either unregistered Pools, or unregistered tokens for registered Pools.

    // Authorizer
    //
    // Some system actions are permissioned, like setting and collecting protocol fees. This permissioning system exists
    // outside of the Vault in the Authorizer contract: the Vault simply calls the Authorizer to check if the caller
    // can perform a given action.
    // The only exception to this are relayers. A relayer is an account (typically a contract) that can use the Internal
    // Balance and Vault allowance of other accounts. For an account to be able to wield this power, two things must
    // happen:
    //  - it must be allowed by the Authorizer to call the functions where it intends to use this permission
    //  - it must be allowed by each individual user to act in their stead
    // This combined requirements means users cannot be tricked into allowing malicious relayers (because they will not
    // have been allowed by the Authorizer), nor can a malicious Authorizer allow malicious relayers to drain user funds
    // (unless the user then allows this malicious relayer).

    // constant product one popularized by Balancer v1. Swap costs are smaller compared to general Pools, and are

    // tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'), and tokens of one
    // other kind are sent from the Pool to the sender in exchange (this is the 'token out'). More complex swaps, such
    // as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together individual swaps.
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps by using the output of one of them as the input for the other, as
    // well as the opposite. This extended swap is known as a 'multihop' swap, since it 'hops' through a number of
    // intermediate tokens before arriving at the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes

    // much less gas than they would otherwise.

    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (but
    // updating the Pool's internal balances).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or minimum
    // amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used both when sending and receiving tokens.

    // swap gas costs and interface simplicity, protocol swap fees are not charged on each individual swap. Rather,
    // Pools are expected to keep track of how many swap fees they have charged, and pay any outstanding debts to the

    // exiting a Pool in debt without first paying their share.
