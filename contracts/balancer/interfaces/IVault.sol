    // the two tokens involved in the swap. This is suitable for some pricing algorithms, like the weighted constant
    // product one popularized by Balancer v1. Swap gas cost is independent of the number of tokens in the Pool.

    // tokens, which allows for a specialized balance packing format. Like minimal swap info Pools, these are called via
