// Based on the EnumerableMap library from OpenZeppelin Contracts, altered to include the following:
//  * a map from IERC20 to bytes32
//  * entries are stored in mappings instead of arrays, reducing implicit storage reads for out-of-bounds checks
//  * unchecked_at and unchecked_valueAt, which allow for more gas efficient data reads in some scenarios
//  * unchecked_indexOf and unchecked_setAt, which allow for more gas efficient data writes in some scenarios
//
// Additionally, the base private functions that work on bytes32 were removed and replaced with a native implementation
// for IERC20 keys, to reduce bytecode size and runtime costs.
