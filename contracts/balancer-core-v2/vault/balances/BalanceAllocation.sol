// This library is used to create a data structure that represents a token's balance for a Pool. 'cash' is how many
// tokens the Pool has sitting inside of the Vault. 'managed' is how many tokens were withdrawn from the Vault by the
// Pool's Asset Manager. 'total' is the sum of these two, and represents the Pool's total token balance, including
// tokens that are *not* inside of the Vault.
//
// 'cash' is updated whenever tokens enter and exit the Vault, while 'managed' is only updated if the reason tokens are
// moving is due to an Asset Manager action. This is reflected in the different methods available: 'increaseCash'
// and 'decreaseCash' for swaps and add/remove liquidity events, and 'cashToManaged' and 'managedToCash' for
// events transferring funds to and from the asset manager.
//
// The Vault disallows the Pool's 'cash' ever becoming negative, in other words, it can never use any tokens that
// are not inside of the Vault.
//
// One of the goals of this library is to store the entire token balance in a single storage slot, which is we we use
// 112 bit unsigned integers for 'cash' and 'managed'. Since 'total' is also a 112 bit unsigned value, any combination
// of 'cash' and 'managed' that yields a 'total' that doesn't fit in that range is disallowed.
//
// The remaining 32 bits of each storage slot are used to store the most recent block number where a balance was
// updated. This can be used to implement price oracles that are resilient to 'sandwich' attacks.
//
// We could use a Solidity struct to pack these two values together in a single storage slot, but unfortunately Solidity
// only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or memory. Because a memory struct still takes up a
// slot in the stack (to store its memory location), and because the entire balance fits in a single stack slot (two
// 112 bit values), using memory is strictly less gas performant. Therefore, we do manual packing and unpacking. The
// type we use to represent these values is bytes32, as it doesn't have any arithmetic operations and therefore reduces
// the chance of misuse.
